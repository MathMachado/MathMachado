I started my journey in Data Science in 2004 after my Master degree in Probability and Statistics at the University of SÃ£o Paulo (IME - USP). Therefore, 17+ years of hands-on experience in building end-to-end Machine Learning solutions. I'm a go-getter, a lifelong learner and passionate about technology and its application to change people's life for good. I'm now an AWS Obsessed: DataOps, MLOps and AWS Solutions Architect.
